## Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s. The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions <video> and <audio> elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.
2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element. In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way. Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.
3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element? this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex? CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has different use cases — and they actually work together quite well! Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

## Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive? Responsive image technologies were implemented recently to solve the problems indicated above by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction).
2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used. srecset is when One or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image sources for the user agent to use. Img is source size values specify the intended display size of the image. User agents use the current source size to select one of the sources supplied by the srcset attribute, when those sources are described using width (w) descriptors. The selected source size affects the intrinsic size of the image (the image's display size if no CSS styling is applied). If the srcset attribute is absent, or contains no values with a width descriptor, then the sizes attribute has no effect.
