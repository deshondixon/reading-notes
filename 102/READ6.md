## Alert

Alert in Javascript will create a pop on your browser of choice with a message in text:

      <script language="javascript">
 
      alert("Hello World");
 
      </script>


     There are endless things to do and create in Javascript but for now give this a try to get an introduction to what the software can do.

## Prompt

Similar to alert prompt creates a pop with text but you can also fill in a text box and get returned another message:

      <script>
 
      var name = prompt("Your name:", "");
      document.write("Hello ", name);
 
      </script>



      <script>
 
      var name = prompt("Please correct your e-mail address:", "foo@bar.co");
      document.write("Your e-mail address is ", name);
 
      </script>
     

     Try out one or both of these examples to see what you create. I've only just been introduced to Javascript but I am excited for the endless possibilities.
