## Functions

A function is just a block of code this code is made to perform a task. 

A function is performed then when calls it too.

Here is an example of how this works:

     function myFunction(p1, p2) {
     return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
     }

## Operators

There are a variety of operators with in JavaScript.

Here are a few:

     Aritmetic Operators
     Assignment Operators
     Comparison Operators
     Logical Operators
     Conditional Operators
     Type Operators

Here are examples of operators:

     let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
     let y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
     let z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)

I've only touched the surface on topic of operators but there is much more to learn soon.
