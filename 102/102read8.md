# *Read: 08 - Operators and Loops*

## Expressions and Operators

The are two forms of expressions:

     Expressions with side effects
     Expressions that evaluate

Here is an example of expressions with side effects:

     x = 7

Here is an example of expressions that only evaluate:

     3 + 4

These expressions is combine to together by operators:

The operators used in the above examples are:

     =
     +

## Loops

Loops allow us to do something over and over in a fast and effective way.

Loops are similar to that of a game that you tell some to take X amount of steps one way and Y steps in another way.

Here is an example of a Loop:

     for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
     // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
     console.log('Walking east one step');
     }

There's different types of loops but they essentially do the same as the others.

This is a small introduction the topics of loops I'm still learning much of it as I go but still motivated to learn it all
