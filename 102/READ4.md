## WIREFRAMING

    I learned that wireframing is used to setup the layout of your application, website, or which product you creating at the time.
    
    Wireframing enables a developer to get a outline of what their site will look like before the project is started and they are able to work together with their client to formal the website, application, or product before any coding is started.

## HTML

    We got a chance to use HTML for a little bit in class today. I was able to learn that HTML is used to give a website it's structure. You don't get a chance to add all your crazy designs yet but you use to HTML to build the foundation of your website.

    HTML add meaning to the text you are writing in programs like VSCODE.

    You can do various things in HTML:

    - Create Hyperlinks
    - Do advanced text formatting
    - Build your document/web structure
    _ You can also debugging you HTML
