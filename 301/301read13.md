# *Readings: More CRUD

## CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API? Update.
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter? Put/Update.

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API 

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD? CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands. It is a way of creating, modifying, and deleting information for the user. CRUD functions can exist in a REST API, but REST APIs are not limited to CRUD functions.
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be? Identify the resources, create model uri's, determine resource representations, assign http methods, and logging/security.
