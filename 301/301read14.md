# *Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? Personal computers were released and targeted towards boys and men.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? It changed the narrative that computers were for men and boys and started a revolution and define the current tech culture and defined who geeks were. Most when then stopped growing up learn how to use computers cause parents were more likely to buy the computer for the boys rather than the girls and so boys ended up being more computer savvy strictly because of growing up with them when girls weren't given this opportunity.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies / Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful? When they are power by commitment from the leaders in a company.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better? They offer a diverse way of approaching problems and offer quicker more efficient solutions.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. When YouTubeâ€™s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
