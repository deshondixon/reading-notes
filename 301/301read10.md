## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’? When a function is invoked.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? One at a time.
3. What does LIFO mean? It means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack. <img width="959" alt="Image Credit-CMU" src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/QgR2uIk7tW0YNz0Xm8g0jAPeRFI0e4sCejsv">
5. What causes a Stack Overflow? there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## JavaScript error messages

1. What is a ‘reference error’? When you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
2. What is a ‘syntax error’? When you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
3. What is a ‘range error’? When you try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length.
4. What is a ‘type error’? when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
5. What is a breakpoint? An example would be console.log() to check and debug your code.
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? Put a breakpoint in your statement so you can check/debug your code.
