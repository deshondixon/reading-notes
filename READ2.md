*I learned Terminal allows us to input commands so our computer can process these codes. It allows us to make changes to our operating system. It allows us to use our operation system in a more effiecent way.*

## Opening a Terminal

Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.

    If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
    If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
    If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .
    
*I also learned that there are various text editors such as Text Edit, Notepad, or Gedit depending on your operating system. The are alternate text editors that you can find online such as Notepad++, TextWrangler, BBEdit, and the one I'm currently learning to use is Visual Studio Code.*

# What is a text editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
