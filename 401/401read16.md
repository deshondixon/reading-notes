# Read: Class 16 - Serverless Functions

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

## Pro's :
- Enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.

- Event streaming and messaging: Serverless architectures are well-suited for event-driven and stream-processing workloads most notably the open source Apache Kafka event streaming platform.

- API gateways: API gateways act as proxies to web actions and provide HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, viewing API usage, viewing response logs, and API sharing policies.

- Improved developer productivity: serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure. It gives developers much more time to innovate and optimize their front-end application functionality and business logic.

- Pay for execution only: The meter starts when the request is made, and ends when execution finishes. 
Develop in any language: Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework—Java, Python, JavaScript, node.js.

- Streamlined development/DevOps cycles. Serverless simplifies deployment and, in a larger sense, simplifies DevOps because developers don't spend time defining infrastructure required to integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production.

- Cost-effective performance. For certain workloads—embarrassingly parallel processing, stream processing, certain data processing tasks—serverless computing can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.

- Usage visibility. Serverless platforms provide near-total visibility into system and user times and can aggregate usage information systematically.

## CON's: 
- Security. You'll hand part of your data to another company that may or may not protect it. Of the 60 percent of companies that don't adopt serverless systems, their leading concerns with the model are security and fear of the unknown. 

- Privacy. Your resources are shared in cloud environments that could also be inhabited by others. 

- Complexity. If something isn't working as it should, spotting the issue could be difficult. You'll have multiple spaces in which to look. 
Contracts. Some vendors lock their clients into long-term agreements.

## Things I want to know more about:
I want to learn more about the security risks involved with using serverless and whether or not the risk is worth it I understand that it allows a developer to focus more on the problem solving and coding aspect but if the security risk is too serve is it even worth it to go serveless.
