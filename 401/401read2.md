# Readings: Testing and Modules

## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

Unit tests are used to test our code and should be used each time you complete a section of code. This insures functionality and further errors down the road.

TDD is also important because you can really battle test your site for any possibility that can arise that would be a major issue once completely deployed a majority of web sites would be in disarray if Unit tests and TDD wasn't done.

The cycle is made by three steps:

Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right?

Write the feature and make the test pass!

Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one

## If name equals main

If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”.

If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable.

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

## Recursion

Recursion is when a function calls on itself directly/indirectly
This in-turn becomes a recursion function
You can use this to handle small problems within the main problem.
