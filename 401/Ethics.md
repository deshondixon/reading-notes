# Ethics

- In the workplace, ethics are critical and should encompass safeguarding human rights and respecting one's autonomy. Personally, this is one of the reasons why I was drawn to the tech industry, as it is an industry that places a significant emphasis on human rights compared to other industries where individuals are treated merely as numbers, with little regard for their human rights. Even though the tech field still has its flaws, it is a significant improvement from the industries I have worked in previously. Furthermore, it is vital to prevent harm, including mental health issues, in the workplace, and this is another reason why I appreciate technology as it is a mentally taxing career that requires mental health considerations. When it comes to ethics in technology, I believe that selling facial recognition software is an abuse of technology. The potential for abuse is too high, and there have been cases where law enforcement has violated human rights using facial recognition software. Thus, it is critical that software quality is held to a high standard, as it reflects the standards set by all software development. Ethical management in the technology realm is paramount, considering that many people entrust their information and privacy rights to technology.
