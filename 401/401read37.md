# Read: Class 37 - React 1

## ES6 Overview

- ES6 introduced the let keyword, which allows for block-scoped variables which cannot be hoisted or redeclared.

      ES5
      var x = 0
      ES6
      let x = 0

- ES6 introduced the const keyword, which cannot be redeclared or reassigned, but is not immutable.

      ES6
      const CONST_IDENTIFIER = 0 // constants are uppercase by convention

- The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own this, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.

      ES5
      function func(a, b, c) {} // function declaration
      var func = function (a, b, c) {} // function expression

      ES6
      let func = (a) => {} // parentheses optional with one parameter
      let func = (a, b, c) => {} // parentheses required with multiple parameters

## React

- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

## Tailwind CSS

- A common reaction to this approach is wondering, “isn’t this just inline styles?” and in some ways it is — you’re applying styles directly to elements instead of assigning them a class name and then styling that class.

But using utility classes has a few important advantages over inline styles:

Designing with constraints. Using inline styles, every value is a magic number. With utilities, you’re choosing styles from a predefined design system, which makes it much easier to build visually consistent UIs.
Responsive design. You can’t use media queries in inline styles, but you can use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to build fully responsive interfaces easily.
Hover, focus, and other states. Inline styles can’t target states like hover or focus, but Tailwind’s state variants make it easy to style those states with utility classes.
This component is fully responsive and includes a button with hover and focus styles, and is built entirely with utility classes:

      <div class="py-8 px-8 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg space-y-2 sm:py-4 sm:flex sm:items-center sm:space-y-0 sm:space-x-6">
        <img class="block mx-auto h-24 rounded-full sm:mx-0 sm:shrink-0" src="/img/erin-lindford.jpg" alt="Woman's Face">
        <div class="text-center space-y-2 sm:text-left">
          <div class="space-y-0.5">
            <p class="text-lg text-black font-semibold">
              Erin Lindford
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-500 font-medium">
              Product Engineer
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="px-4 py-1 text-sm text-purple-600 font-semibold rounded-full border border-purple-200 hover:text-white hover:bg-purple-600 hover:border-transparent focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-600 focus:ring-offset-2">Message</button>
        </div>
      </div>

## Next.js

- Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
Development environment with Fast Refresh support
API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
Fully extendable
Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

## Things I want to know more about

- Want to learn more about functional component its going to take some getting used to but so far I love it.
