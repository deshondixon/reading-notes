## NextJs

- Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.

- The public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets.

- With regular HTML, you would add your profile picture as follows:

        <img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Your Name" />

  However, this means you have to manually handle:

Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes
Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library
Only loading images when they enter the viewport
And more. Instead, Next.js provides an Image component out of the box to handle this for you.

- next/image is an extension of the HTML < img > element, evolved for the modern web.

- Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it. This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats.

- Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.

- Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.

- Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.

- Images are always rendered in such a way as to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift, a Core Web Vital that Google is going to use in search ranking.

- What if we wanted to modify the metadata of the page, such as the < title > HTML tag?

< title > is part of the < head > HTML tag, so let's dive into how we can modify the < head > tag in a Next.js page.

Open pages/index.js in your editor and find the following lines:

    <Head>
      <title>Create Next App</title>
      <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
    </Head>

Notice that < Head > is used instead of the lowercase < head >. < Head > is a React Component that is built into Next.js. It allows you to modify the < head > of a page.

- You can import the Head component from the next/head module.

- Adding Head to first-post.js
- We haven't added a < title > to our /posts/first-post route. Let's add one.

- Open the pages/posts/first-post.js file and add an import for Head from next/head at the beginning of the file:

        import Head from 'next/head';

  Then, update the exported FirstPost component to include the Head component. For now, we‘ll add just the title tag:

      export default function FirstPost() {
        return (
          <>
            <Head>
              <title>First Post</title>
            </Head>
            <h1>First Post</h1>
            <h2>
              <Link href="/">← Back to home</Link>
            </h2>
          </>
        );
      }

  Try accessing http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post. The browser tab should now say “First Post”. By using your browser’s developer tools, you should see that the title tag is added to < head >.

## React Context for Beginners

- React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

Here is an example of props drilling. In this application, we have access to theme data that we want to pass as a prop to all of our app's components.

As you can see, however, the direct children of App, such as Header, also have to pass the theme data down using props.

    export default function App({ theme }) {
      return (
        <>
          <Header theme={theme} />
          <Main theme={theme} />
          <Sidebar theme={theme} />
          <Footer theme={theme} />
        </>
      );
    }

    function Header({ theme }) {
      return (
        <>
          <User theme={theme} />
          <Login theme={theme} />
          <Menu theme={theme} />
        </>
      );
    }

What is the issue with this example?

- The issue is that we are drilling the theme prop through multiple components that don't immediately need it.

- The Header component doesn't need theme other than to pass it down to its child component. In other words, it would be better for - - - User , Login and Menu to consume the theme data directly.

- This is the benefit of React context – we can bypass using props entirely and therefore avoid the issue of props drilling.

- Context is an API that is built into React, starting from React version 16.

- This means that we can create and use context directly by importing React in any React project.

- There are four steps to using React context:

- Create context using the createContext method.
- Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
- Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
- Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.
- Does all this sound confusing? It's simpler than you think.

- Let's take a look at a very basic example. In our App, let's pass down our own name using Context and read it in a nested component: User.

      import React from 'react';

      export const UserContext = React.createContext();

      export default function App() {
        return (
          <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
            <User />
          </UserContext.Provider>
        )
      }

      function User() {
        return (
          <UserContext.Consumer>
            {value => <h1>{value}</h1>}
            {/* prints: Reed */}
          </UserContext.Consumer>
        )
      }

Let's break down what we are doing, step-by-step:

Above our App component, we are creating context with React.createContext() and putting the result in a variable, UserContext. In almost every case, you will want to export it as we are doing here because your component will be in another file. Note that we can pass an initial value to our value prop when we call React.createContext().
In our App component, we are using UserContext. Specifically UserContext.Provider. The created context is an object with two properties: Provider and Consumer, both of which are components. To pass our value down to every component in our App, we wrap our Provider component around it (in this case, User).
On UserContext.Provider, we put the value that we want to pass down our entire component tree. We set that equal to the value prop to do so. In this case, it is our name (here, Reed).
In User, or wherever we want to consume (or use) what was provided on our context, we use the consumer component: UserContext.Consumer. To use our passed down value, we use what is called the render props pattern. It is just a function that the consumer component gives us as a prop. And in the return of that function, we can return and use value.

## Things I want to know more about

- Still used to passing props to components so its going to take some getting used to not having to do that I want to know more about context.
