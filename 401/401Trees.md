#### *I've chosen a vocabulary list as my choice to teach today.*

## Node 
A tree is a data structure consisting of nodes. A tree node can have a value and references to other nodes, called children

## Root 
The root of the tree is the topmost node, and it does not have a parent

## K 
In a k-ary tree, each node can have up to k children. In a binary tree, each node can have up to 2 children, referred to as the left and right child

## Left
A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

## Right 
A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

## Edge
The connection between a parent node and a child node is called an edge

## Leaf 
A leaf is a node that does not have any children

## Height 
The height of a tree is the distance from the root to the farthest leaf node, measured in the number of edges.
