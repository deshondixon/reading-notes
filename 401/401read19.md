## Python Regex

*Regex are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.*


To import regex:

      import re

Ordinary characters can be used to perform simple exact matches:

    pattern = r"Cookie" sequence = "Cookie" if re.match(pattern, sequence): print("Match!") else: print("Not a match!")


---
    Match!


The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None.



### *Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression. For simple understanding, they can be thought of as reserved metacharacters that denote something else and not what they look like.*


    . - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.

---

    re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()

---

    'Cookie'

---

    ^ - A caret. Matches the start of the string.

This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence starts with certain characters.

    re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat cake!").group() ## However, the code below will not give the same result. Try it for yourself: # re.search(r'^eat', "Let's eat cake!").group()

---

    'Eat'

---

    $ - Matches the end of string.

This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence ends with certain characters.

    re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group() ## The next search will return the NONE value, try it: # re.search(r'cake$', "Let's get some cake on our way home!").group()

---

    'cake'

---

    [abc] - Matches a or b or c.
    [a-zA-Z0-9] - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).

---

    re.search(r'[0-6]', 'Number: 5').group()

---

    '5'


    ## Matches any character except 5 re.search(r'Number: [^5]', 'Number: 0').group() ## This will not match and hence a NONE value will be returned #re.search(r'Number: [^5]', 'Number: 5').group()


    'Number: 0'

## Things I want to know more about

Honestly the whole concept of regex still gives me trouble I think I finally understand it then I run into another issue which then confuses me but I'll just keeping digging for information to better understand the topic.
