## Create a vocabulary/definition list

- *Vertex* - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

- *Edge* - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

- *Neighbor* - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- *Degree* - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

- *Undirected Graph* - a graph where each edge is undirected or bidirectional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

- *Directed Graph* - a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

- *Complete Graphs* - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

- *Connected* - A connected graph is graph that has all vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

- *Disconnected* - A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

- *Acyclic Graph* - An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

- *Cyclic Graphs* - A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

- *Adjacency Matrix* - An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

- *Adjacency List* - An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all the other vertices that are connected.

- *Weighted Graphs* - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
