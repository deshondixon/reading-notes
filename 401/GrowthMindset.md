Growth Mindset
My understanding of growth mindset is that continuous growth leads to more productivity. Continuous effort to grow yourself leads to an increase in abilities. Everyone has different starting points in their intelligence but constant growth cause allow even a person who has a lower intelligence level to excel above over others that have a higher starting point in their intelligence. I have strong belief in the growth mindset, even though I've never been considered smart in the past, in my adult life I've been able to grow my intelligence at a rapid pace because I learned to love learning and always strive to learn more.

Reminders
Don't get comfortable and stuck in my ways. Strive to new learn something new even and take a different approach to my usual methods.
Even if I fail at something don't give up. Learn from your mistakes and understand why those mistakes where made.
Your old tricks and method will fade out quick. You'll realize those that chose to continue to learn excel above others.
