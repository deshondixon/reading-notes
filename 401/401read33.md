## What is JSON Web Token?
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

- Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

## How to Use JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework

- The JWT is just an authorization token that should be included in all requests:

        curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQzODI4NDMxLCJqdGkiOiI3ZjU5OTdiNzE1MGQ0NjU3OWRjMmI0OTE2NzA5N2U3YiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.Ju70kdcaHKn1Qaz8H42zrOYk0Jx9kIckTn9Xx7vhikY'

- The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.

- The access token is usually short-lived (expires in 5 min or so, can be customized though).

- The refresh token lives a little bit longer (expires in 24 hours, also customizable). It is comparable to an authentication session. After it expires, you need a full login with username + password again.

Why is that?

- It’s a security feature and also it’s because the JWT holds a little bit more information. If you look closely the example I gave above, you will see the token is composed by three parts:

        xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

Those are three distinctive parts that compose a JWT:

    header.payload.signature

So we have here:

    header = eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9
    payload = eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQzODI4NDMxLCJqdGkiOiI3ZjU5OTdiNzE1MGQ0NjU3OWRjMmI0OTE2NzA5N2U3YiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9
    signature = Ju70kdcaHKn1Qaz8H42zrOYk0Jx9kIckTn9Xx7vhikY

This information is encoded using Base64. If we decode, we will see something like this:

### header

    {
      "typ": "JWT",
      "alg": "HS256"
    }

### payload

    {
      "token_type": "access",
      "exp": 1543828431,
      "jti": "7f5997b7150d46579dc2b49167097e7b",
      "user_id": 1
    }

### signature

- The signature is issued by the JWT backend, using the header base64 + payload base64 + SECRET_KEY. Upon each request this signature is verified. If any information in the header or in the payload was changed by the client it will invalidate the signature. The only way of checking and validating the signature is by using your application’s SECRET_KEY. Among other things, that’s why you should always keep your SECRET_KEY secret!

## Things I want to know more about

- I have had experience with Jwsn token in the past, and they have always been a struggle for me. I for see it being a struggle in this context as well but I'll dive deeper into to the topic to gain a better understanding and hopefully I don't run into similar issues.
